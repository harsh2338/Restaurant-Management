One of the major problems faced by customers in Restaurants is the time spent waiting to receive
their orders. Time is a valuable asset and it is the restaurant's responsibility to ensure that the
customer spends more time eating than waiting.
So this is an app which is used by customers to book a table and add the time they will arrive at the restaurant so that the food they have ordered will be ready as soon as they sit for dining.
